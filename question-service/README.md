# Question Service

This service facilitates fetching questions from Leetcode. In the event that the API from Leetcode fails, it will serve static questions randomly based on difficulty to users.

## Run Service

1. Install npm packages using `npm i`.
2. Run Question Service using `npm run start` or `npm run dev` for hot reload during development.
